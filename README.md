# sandbox

A plugin based sandbox to play around with multiple tools.
The sandbox idea is to have low level independent modules/apps, which follow a specific set of requirements to display a UI, and integrate into the sandbox. These apps can then be utilized in any way the developer wants, including chaining different events/actions exposed by an app into another app.
The architectyure will be described below:
